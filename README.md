read the report pdf for more details
the dynamics are computed symbolically at the Dynamics.py file then lambdified.
the kinematics are very easy and they are computed at the Robot.py .

this was a project for the class: "Human Reinforcement Learning: Algorithms and Hands-on Practice" Summer Semester 2019.
